# RayTracing
 Ray tracing is a technique for modeling light transport for use in a wide variety of rendering algorithms for generating digital images.
 It is a system that's used to enhance the lighting in games. This is done in a variety of different ways. It's used in everything from
 reflections to shadows both in the gaming environment and on items within it. This includes things like atmospheric effects, reflections on surfaces 
 (water, metal, glass) and even diffused lighting. 
 
 The ray-tracing algorithm takes an image made of pixels. For each pixel in the image, it shoots a primary ray into the scene.
 If this particular ray does not intersect an object on its way to the light, the hit point is illuminated. If it does intersect 
 with another object, that object casts a shadow on it
